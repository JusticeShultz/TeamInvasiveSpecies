This is where materials will go for certain assets.

It's recommended you put each genre in its own folder.

E.g.

Have a folder named "Eye Candy" and all eye candy materials go there.

or

Have a folder named "Enemies" and have a seperate folder for each enemy in there with each enemy material in those.
